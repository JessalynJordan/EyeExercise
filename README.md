# Interactive Eyes Demo

This is a simple HTML webpage that demonstrates interactive eyes that follow the movement of the mouse cursor.

## Description

The webpage consists of two eyes, each represented by a white ball within a black circle. The eyes are positioned on the webpage, and their movement is controlled by the mouse cursor.

## Features
